> For this project, we face a real client! That was amazing to learn how to work directly for Ocean Digital!

### Increase our fullstack skills!

We have 2 month to do our first fullstack app!
We had 2 days per week allocated to the project during the training.
The rest is on own hand during our free time.

### What we use in this project?

After the second project, we learned SQL and how to use it with Express.js. This was a significant step, and now we are facing the challenge of the final group project with all that we have learned so far.

### Autonomy

This time, we are tackling the challenge mostly on our own (with exceptions for major difficulties). We are following the Scrum Master methodology. I have experimented more than in the last project with all the roles – PO, Scrum Master – and I am also experimenting with a new role: Lead Designer.

### More to Come

Stay tuned for further updates.
