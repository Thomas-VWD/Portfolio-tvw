For this project, we had three major points to implement, and we were free to choose the theme.

1 - Building a REACT app.

2 - Creating an app that utilizes a public API.

3 - Appling SCRUM, an agile methodology.

We quickly identified an exciting theme for our app. Since all of us enjoy good beer and some of us are familiar with Tinder... Match! TindBeer is born!

Throughout this project, we gained extensive experience working with the SCRUM methodology. Each of us had the opportunity to take on roles such as Scrum Master, Product Owner, or developer.

Furthermore, it provided an excellent opportunity to enhance our REACT skills.

This project was not designed by our school to be publish online, so I make a good video of it on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7072583813456957440/">Linkedin profile</a>
