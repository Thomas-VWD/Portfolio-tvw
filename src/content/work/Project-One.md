> During this first project, the objective was to initiate collaborative coding within the project, learn how to use Git & GitHub.

We face our first merge! It was a confusing experience, causing some CSS-related challenges... However, we gained significant insights from overcoming these difficulties.

##### So, what did the project involve?

- Creating a static mobile-first web page.
- Applying the knowledge we had acquired up to that point:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Git & Github

Over the course of three weeks, we allocated one day to the project as part of the training schedule, while the rest of the work was done during our free time.

Following this initial static project, we learned valuable lessons about best practices and pitfalls to avoid, which guided us for future projects.

This experience was truly enlightening, and we are now prepared for the next step, even though we are uncertain about the specifics: learning teamwork in projects using SCRUM!"
