> How to organize a Hackathon? This is what we learned from our first one. All the web development and design students competed for this project, working for a real client: EMAUS.

#### Two day

This was the duration of this hackathon.
First, we familiarize ourself with Emaus project.

#### The first day

On the first morning, we built our database prototype.

After the design team gave us acces to their Figma project, we selected the one we liked and began coding.

We decided to split the team fifty-fifty, with two of us working on the frontend and the other on the backend.

#### Last day

End of the hackhaton: 10 a.m.
After a small night, we fix the last feature and present our app to the jury.

### Conclusion

We learned a lot!

Firstly, we were surprised by how many features we managed to develop in such a short amount of time.

Secondly, even though our project was not selected by the jury during the semifinals, we feel proud of what we accomplished within this limited timeframe.

Finally, we reaffirm our confidence in our coding abilities.
